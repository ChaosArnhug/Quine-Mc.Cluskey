# Quine-Mc.Cluskey

Learning project based on Quine-Mc.Cluskey logic optimisation method i learned [here](https://www.ulb.be/en/programme/2023-elec-h310) at the ULB.
The goal is for me to learn about programming in Rust so the code may not be optimised / may be completely dumb. 

### Current project capabilities

- Accept 0 to 255 as minterms
- Produce all the tables containing every combination possible by the rule of the method, free of duplicate.
- Indicate if a combination has been used in a further table


### Planned (one day in my life)
- Finish the Analysis phase with the extraction of prime implicants
- Do the synthesis phase
- Open a prompt to ask about the minterms we want (no need to change it in the code)
- print result in a file

### Disclaimer

Not intensively tested so it might contain errors with the combination
